      'content': 'In a surprising move, President-elect Donald Trump has decided to move his inauguration ceremony indoors, citing concerns over extremely cold weather. The decision marks a significant break from historical traditions, which typically see the event held on the steps of the Capitol. While the shift is seen as a practical measure to ensure comfort and safety, it will inevitably reduce the grandeur and public visibility of the occasion. Critics argue that the move could diminish the symbolic significance of the event, while supporters claim it is a necessary step given the harsh winter conditions.',
